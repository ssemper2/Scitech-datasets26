# This dataset contains diagnostic measurements of cell nuclei taken from breast cancer biopsy samples, labeled as benign or malignant. It could be used to answer questions about which cellular features differ most between benign and malignant tumors. This dataset is relevant to genomic medicine because it supports disease classification and early detection based on biological measurements. One challenge was deciding which of the many available columns to focus on for analysis considering there were no null or n/a columns which would be my first choice to forego. Overall, the dataset was well structured and easy to explore using Pandas and Matplotlib.
